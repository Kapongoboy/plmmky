# Plmmky

Plmmky is a interpreter (and maybe in the future a compiler?) for the
monkey language written in Zig. Following the trend of my recent projects
this is prodominantly a learning project, to figure out how interpreters
and compilers work, as well as getting more familiar with Zig.

When the project is in a functional state, build instructions will be added,
but until then, all the best!
